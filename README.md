5 Basic Human Psychological Needs
=================================
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bibharajeev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software engineering leadership and human leadership.
- We all are aware of basic human physiological needs (e.g. food, shelter, clothing, water, air, sleep etc.) but is it enough for a human to thrive?
- What are basic human psychological needs?
- I have coined a word **TEAMS** to describe 5 basic human psychological needs for humans across culture to thrive in any work environment:

-   **T: Teamwork** (All humans want to be part of a group or a team)
-   **E: Equality** (All humans want to be treated with equality and fairness)
-   **A: Appreciation** (All humans want to be appreciated, feel important and have significance in their life)
-   **M: Motivation** (All humans want to be motivated and motivation comes from freedom and growth)
-   **S: Stability** (All humans want stability of resources in their life)
